## from the silicon to the web

Hiring is hard, a lot of modern CS education is really bad, and it's hard to find people who understand the modern computer stack from first principles.

This project is about fun and learning. It is about the journey, NOT THE DESTINATION. Enjoy yourself. If you aren't, take a break and try something entirely different.

Perhaps this project is what you've been thinking about. Moving past academic exercises, this is computing and why does it suck so bad?

Let's proceed thoughtfully and make informed decisions. Can we code in languages that are less prone to bugs? i.e., avoid Python and C, think OCaml, Haskell, and Rust. Things worth learning, not trash you'll rapidily code followed by days of debugging. We're crafting the entire stack, we have choices.

What's changed is there's tons of compute available for compilation. Self-hosting is explicitly not a goal. Compilers should engage more in "search" and "model" processes, rather than mere "translation".

### tidbit

This project draws inspiration and is deeply influenced from several prominent figures in computer science and technology:

These individuals have pushed the boundaries of what's possible in computing, often by reimagining fundamental concepts and building from the ground up.
